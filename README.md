## System Architecture Overview

### Alignment System (D&D-Style Rules)

Agents operate under **4 distinct alignment frameworks**, each modifying rule strictness, behavior, and optimization:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    ALIGNMENT SPECTRUM                    │
├──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┤
│  LAWFUL_GOOD │ NEUTRAL_GOOD │ CHAOTIC_GOOD │   CHAOTIC   │
│              │              │              │   NEUTRAL   │
├──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Strictness:  │ Strictness:  │ Strictness:  │ Strictness: │
│ 95%          │ 70%          │ 40%          │ 0%          │
│              │              │              │             │
│ Temp: 0.3    │ Temp: 0.5    │ Temp: 0.7    │ Temp: 0.9   │
│ TopP: 0.7    │ TopP: 0.85   │ TopP: 0.95   │ TopP: 1.0   │
└──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### Rule Progression (3-Rule Expansion)

```
Agent #1 (LAWFUL_GOOD)    : 6 baseline + 3 experimental = 9 total
Agent #2 (NEUTRAL_GOOD)   : 6 baseline + 6 experimental = 12 total
Agent #3 (CHAOTIC_GOOD)   : 6 baseline + 9 experimental = 15 total
Agent #4 (CHAOTIC_NEUTRAL): 6 baseline + 12 experimental = 18 total
```

Each agent receives additional rules tailored to its alignment and optimization goals (reduce-hallucination, token-efficiency, bug-detection, architecture, security).

## 6 Immutable Baseline Rules

These are **locked, cryptographically-signed, and auditable**:

### Rule 1: API Verification (OWASP, RFC compliance)

```
NEVER output unverified code. All APIs, libraries, and functions 
MUST be verified against official documentation (*.org, *.gov domains, 
peer-reviewed sources). Include version numbers, RFC compliance, and 
publication dates. ZERO tolerance for hallucinated methods.
```

**Source:** OWASP Code Review Guidelines + RFC 7231 (HTTP Semantics)  
**Why:** Prevents data poisoning, injection vulnerabilities (CWE-89), auth bypass (CWE-287)  
**Verification:** Every code sample is cross-checked against official docs before output

### Rule 2: Error Handling (NIST SP 800-53)

```
ALWAYS implement comprehensive error handling: try-catch-finally blocks, 
graceful degradation, explicit error logging, retry logic with exponential 
backoff. NO silent failures. All error states must be testable.
```

**Source:** NIST SP 800-53 (Error Handling and Logging Control)  
**Why:** Prevents information disclosure (CWE-209), denial of service (CWE-248)  
**Implementation:** Every function includes error capture, logging, and recovery

### Rule 3: Test-Driven Development (IEEE 42010)

```
ENFORCE test-driven development: Unit tests (Jest/Mocha/pytest), 
integration tests, security audits PRECEDE deployment. Minimum 80% 
code coverage. All tests must pass before merge.
```

**Source:** IEEE Software Testing Standard (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010)  
**Why:** Reduces defect rates by 40-50% (McConnell, "Code Complete")  
**Metrics:** Coverage tracked per agent; regressions trigger alerts

### Rule 4: Token Efficiency (OpenAI 2024)

```
OPTIMIZE for token efficiency: Use context compression, avoid redundant 
phrasing, prioritize signal-to-noise ratio. Target <1.5 tokens/word. 
Use pseudocode before full implementation. Batch related concepts.
```

**Source:** OpenAI Research (2024) - Token optimization reduces costs 30-50%  
**Why:** Reduces API costs, improves response latency, increases throughput  
**Optimization:** Tokens are measured per response; efficiency ratio is a KPI

### Rule 5: Scientific Rigor (Academic Standards)

```
MAINTAIN scientific rigor: CITE ALL sources with URLs, version numbers, 
publication dates, and RFC standards. Use ONLY peer-reviewed research, 
NIST/IEEE standards, or official documentation. FLAG speculative claims 
with confidence intervals. Never assume—verify.
```

**Source:** Academic Research Standards + Government Documentation  
**Why:** Prevents unverified claims, enables fact-checking, ensures reproducibility  
**Verification:** Every output is scanned for citations; unverified claims are flagged

### Rule 6: Data Integrity Monitoring (CWE Top 25)

```
SELF-MONITOR for data poisoning, hallucinations, and logical fallacies. 
Cross-validate against ground truth. Report confidence levels. ESCALATE 
to human review if uncertain. Monitor for unverified claims using external 
validation frameworks.
```

**Source:** CWE Top 25 + Anthropic AI Safety Research  
**Why:** Detects adversarial inputs, prevents output corruption, maintains model integrity  
**Implementation:** Real-time monitoring with alerts on confidence drops

## Metrics Framework

### Measured KPIs

| Metric | Type | Range | Target | Rationale |
|--------|------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Hallucinations | Rate | 0%-100% | <5% | Unverified claims undermine trust |
| Bug Density | Count | 0-∞ | <0.1/block | Code quality, security |
| Token Efficiency | Ratio | 0-1.0 | >0.85 | Cost optimization, latency |
| Security Score | OWASP | 0-100% | >85% | Prevents exploits (CWE-based) |
| Logical Consistency | Score | 0-100% | >95% | Prevents contradictions |
| Test Coverage | Percent | 0%-100% | >80% | Defect detection |
| Time to Completion | ms | 0-∞ | <2000ms | Throughput optimization |

### Calculation Example: Productivity Score

```
productivity = (1 - hallucinations) × weight₁ +
               (1 - bugDensity) × weight₂ +
               tokenEfficiency × weight₃ +
               securityScore × weight₄ +
               codeConsistency × weight₅ +
               (1 - logicalFallacies) × weight₆

weights[LAWFUL_GOOD] = {hallucinations: 0.2, bugDensity: 0.3, 
                        securityScore: 0.25, ...}
```

## Audit & Compliance

### Audit Log Format (JSONL)

Every modification is logged with:
- Timestamp (RFC 3339)
- Action (AGENT_CREATED, RULE_MODIFIED, BENCHMARK_RUN, etc.)
- Operator (user ID or system)
- Justification (evidence-based rationale)
- Performance impact (% improvement or regression)
- Security implications (any risks introduced)

### Example Audit Entry

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-19T15:30:00Z",
  "action": "RULE_MODIFICATION",
  "agentId": "agent-2-abc123",
  "rulesModified": 1,
  "justification": "Hallucination rate >15%; added rule for source citation",
  "operator": "scientist-guardian",
  "performanceImpact": 0.08,
  "securityImplications": "No new vulnerabilities; improved OWASP A02 (Cryptographic)"
}
```

This package is structured for npm distribution (`dist/` output, `types` field, `files` whitelist).

### Steps to publish

```bash
# 1. Log in to npm (one-time)
npm login

# 2. Verify the package name is available
npm info agent-swarm-codex-guardian

# 3. Publish (runs typecheck + lint + tests + build automatically)
npm publish --access public
```

`prepublishOnly` in `package.json` ensures tests and the build pass before
anything is pushed to the registry.

### What gets published

Only the files listed in the `files` field of `package.json` are included:
`dist/`, `lib/`, `README.md`, `Codex-Oath.md`, `LICENSE`.
Source files, tests, and configuration are excluded.
